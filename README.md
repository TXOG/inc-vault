# IncVault
IncVault is a file encryption program for Windows designed to provide users with a secure and easy-to-use solution for protecting their files. With IncVault, users can create a secure "locker" folder that is encrypted and password-protected, keeping their files safe from unauthorized access. Please note that you should only interact with files stored in your locker through IncVault, unless you are editing the file contents. If an Antivirus causes any issues, you may have to [create an exception](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+create+an+exception+in+%5Bantivirus%5D&sxsrf=APwXEdck3w8dJJN2pkH660RpQNwrCi0nNQ%3A1682017158274&source=hp&ei=hotBZIDyDJOR8gLKsYOQCw&iflsig=AOEireoAAAAAZEGZltTE6sDECenhHxi9NiJeOVL1udK-&ved=0ahUKEwiAzeKZkrn-AhWTiFwKHcrYALIQ4dUDCAo&uact=5&oq=how+to+create+an+exception+in+%5Bantivirus%5D&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIICAAQigUQhgM6BwgjEOoCECdQ1ARY1ARg6ghoAXAAeACAAW2IAW2SAQMwLjGYAQCgAQKgAQGwAQo&sclient=gws-wiz).
