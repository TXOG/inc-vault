# IncVault
An encrypted vault to help hide and protect files

## Disclaimer
* This program cannot protect files where a hacker can access memory (pretty much nothing can). Do not use this program to be lax with your internet security
* Do **NOT** delete any files created by the program or it can completely break
* Create an exception for the entire directory if you are running an antivirus

## Install
### Download
* Download all the files from the releases tab or gitclone the repo
* Make sure you have python and pip installed
* Main.py and functions.py must be in the same directory
### Pip install
Run these commands in terminal:
* pip install bcrypt
* pip install hashlib
* pip install pathlib
* pip install cryptography
### Run
Run the main.py file (running any others will do nothing)
